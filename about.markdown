Starting out as a Psychology undergrad, I discovered that I had a passion for learning and helping others. After I graduated from Nova Southeastern University (located in Davie, Florida) in 2015, I took some time to discover what I wanted to do. I worked in the meantime, and understood that librarianship was calling me. I have always found a comfort in books, data, and research. I started my Master's program at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro Online School in the Spring semester of 2019.  I am a full-time student, and plan to graduate in Spring 2021. I have a special interest in metadata and cataloging.

When I am not busy studying, I love playing video games, reading, taking nature walks, and exercising. I have a passion for learning about a broad range of subjects. I have two pets whom I love dearly: my bearded dragon named Gimli and my cat named Clover.
